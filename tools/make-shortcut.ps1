.SYNOPSIS
  Creates a desktop shortcut that launches Nimbus without packaging it.

.DESCRIPTION
  Windows 11's Smart App Control blocks executables that are both unsigned and
  unknown to Microsoft's reputation graph. A freshly packaged build is exactly
  that - a one-of-a-kind hash - so it gets blocked, while the stock
  node_modules\electron\dist\electron.exe runs fine because that hash is on
  millions of machines.

  This shortcut launches the app through that already-trusted binary, passing
  the project directory as the app to run. No packaging, no signing, no need to
  weaken any security setting.

  Remove it by deleting the shortcut; nothing else is changed.

.EXAMPLE
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\make-shortcut.ps1
